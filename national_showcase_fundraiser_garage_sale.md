### Theresa Morgan:

So, we've decided to do Kayla's National Showcase fundraiser sale next Thursday & Friday (July 7th & 8th) and possibly through the weekend as well. We are teaming up with another Skating Family who will be going to Nationals as well. If you have anything you'd like to donate for it (books, clothes, toys, tools, baked goods, etc) please let me know. I can arrange to come pick things up if necessary.
