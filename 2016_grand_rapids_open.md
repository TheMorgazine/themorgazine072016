# 2016 Grand Rapids Open

Kayla competed at the 2016 Grand Rapids Open at the Meijer State Games of Michigan on Friday and placed 3rd with her Dramatic Showcase. (Video https://youtu.be/r4NNVL2qhDQ) She had a great time and is excited for the chance to skate as "Alice" again at Nationals in August.

We are continuing to make progress toward our goal to get to National Showcase, but could still use some help if you are able. If you'd rather help in other ways: odd jobs she could do or would like to purchase some of her crafts, etc, please let me know. Every little bit helps. Thank you for all of your support!
