Just a list of the videos that have been posted to Vine.

* [Playing with Grandma's Light Switch](https://vine.co/v/5uxdazt7zOl) - I felt like the sequence of Elijah turning on the first light switch and then turning on the other (just minutes after he had discovered that there were two switches which controlled the same light in the kitchen) fit well within the Vine format, because it helps to show what would have happened if Elijah had been able to just turn the light on and off all day long. I'm pretty sure that's what he wanted to do, until Grandma came in and caught him.
